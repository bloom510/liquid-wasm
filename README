 
 WASM build of liquid-dsp, a DSP library designed specifically for software-defined radios on embedded platforms.

 This library was compiled to WASM by doing the following:

 1. Follow build instructions on Emscripten docs at https://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/compiling/Building-Projects.html
 2. Creating liquid.c to test codes found in the examples folder
 3. Built by running the command: emcc -O3 -s WASM=1 -s EXTRA_EXPORTED_RUNTIME_METHODS='["cwrap"]' \ -I liquid-dsp \ liquid.c \ liquid-dsp/libliquid.so

 Nothing has been done with this WASMified library as of yet. A world of possibilities awaits!
 Write your own functions in liquid.c, import them in the JS at index.html and make sure to build using step 3.

 Spin up a simple HTTP server to run locally.
